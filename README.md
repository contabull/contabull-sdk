# Contabull SDK

This is the official SDK for using our Contabull Public API.

## Client Configuration

- `privateKey` : the private key generated with your public key
- `apiKey` : a secret key we've generated while creating your application in the Contabull's dashboard
- `baseUrl` _(optional)_ : `api.contabull.com` by default
- `timeout` _(optional)_ : `10000`ms by default

To start using our SDK, you've to instantiate it first.

```typescript
const contabull = new Contabull({
  apiKey: 'sk...',
  privateKey: '...',
  baseUrl: 'https://api.contabull.com'
  timeout: 10000,
});
```

## Authorization

If you want to make sure you're all set for using our SDK, the best way is checking your authorization.

```typescript
// const contabull = new Contabull({ ... });

await contabull.authorization.try();
```

#### Response Payload

```json
{ "message": "Hello World, it's all good. ðŸš€" }
```

Now you can use the SDK as your convenience.

```md
# Important

You've to enable resources your application can access and manage in your application's page within the Contabull's dashboard.
```

## Accounts

Access and manage your accounts using the SDK.

### Get all accounts

```typescript
// const contabull = new Contabull({ ... });

await contabull.accounts.getAll();
```

#### Response payload :

```json
[
  {
    "label": "My Company Celcoin Account",
    "balance": {
      "availableBalance": 6000,
      "pendingBalance": 1000
    },
    "bankProvider": "celcoin",
    "number": "1234567890"
  }
]
```

While using the SDK, most of the time you'll have to pass an `account` in query parameters or in the body. The `account` corresponds to the bank account `number`, like shown in the above response example.

You can also find this bank account number in your accounts page of the Contabull's dashboard.
